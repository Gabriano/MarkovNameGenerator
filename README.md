## Notes ##
The underlying concepts for the Markov process were based off of [this article](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Markov_chains-based_name_generation) by [Dominik Marczuk](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=User:Dominikmarczuk).
The internal state of the generator is visualized using d3.js and Haxe externs made for it.
